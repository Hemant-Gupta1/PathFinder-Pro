# Features:
The Java code that is provided uses a graph data structure to construct a metro map system. 
The metro map is represented by the map class, where stations are nodes and connections between stations 
are edges. The code can be used to add and remove nodes, add edges, search for paths, and use Dijkstra's algorithm,
which determines the shortest path based on time or distance. The metro map and list of stations are visualised 
via the display_Map and display_Stations methods, respectively. In general, the code appears to provide a 
framework for metro network management and analysis.
